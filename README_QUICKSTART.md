# Duck Hunt: Snarky Simulation (Quickstart)

## How to Play
1.  **Open the Game**: Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
2.  **Allow Camera**: Click "Allow" when the browser asks for webcam access.
3.  **Controls**:
    - **Aim**: Move your index finger. The crosshair follows your finger tip.
    - **Shoot**: **Pinch** your Index Finger and Thumb together effectively.
    - **Reload**: (Not implemented yet, infinite ammo for now!)
4.  **The Dog**:
    - If you miss or play poorly, the Dog will appear and roast you.
    - If you have an API Key in `.env.local`, the roasts are generated by AI.
    - Otherwise, it uses a built-in list of insults in 4 languages.

## Troubleshooting
- **Crosshair jittery?** improved lighting helps. Ensure your hand is clearly visible.
- **Can't shoot?** Try making a clear "Pinch" gesture (O-shape with thumb and index).
- **No Sound?** Ensure your browser tab is not muted.
